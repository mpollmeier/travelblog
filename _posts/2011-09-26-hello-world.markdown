Hello there! This is the new location for all our travel stories, so please use the <a title="RSS feed" href="http://travelblog.michaelpollmeier.com/feed/#xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> or regularly visit this page if you are interested in where we're hanging around... We've imported the posts from our previous travel blog - those entries are in German but the photos are international ;)

We are flying into Kathmandu on 5/6 October and shall leave a post here once we arrived and figured out how to use Nepalese keyboards - stay tuned ;)
