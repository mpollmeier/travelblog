Last weekend our friends Max and Maggie who lived in Sydney for some time came over for a visit. As we haven't been to Coromandel yet and my colleague just bought a beachhouse there, we stayed there for the weekend. It's said to be one of the nicest areas on the North Island, and indeed: even though it's deepest Winter here (as deep as Winter get's in NZ) it was stunning. My colleague's house is just 500m from the beach with lot's of space, a garden and a fireplace. Really looking forward to going there again!
