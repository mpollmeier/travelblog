We've still been hungry for more hikes after our trip to the South Island, so we did the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-39.1574&amp;lon=175.6282&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=C">Tongariro Circuit</a> last weekend - with Cisco, Antoine, Felix and Maya. We already planned to do it last year but then the vulcano erupted and the DOC closed the track, so we had to wait until it got reopened. The 'crossing' is one of the most popular day walks in New Zealand, so there were a lot of tourists on that part. Afterwards it was pretty much empty so we had the scenery all for ourselves. 

As you can see we got really lucky with the weather so we had stunning views over the whole area! We also climbed Mount Ngaurahoe on Saturday (before doing the actual crossing), a 600m ascent on gravel that couldn't be any steeper. Getting down reminded me of skiing...
