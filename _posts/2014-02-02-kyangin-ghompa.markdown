As promised now some more pictures of Kyanjin Gompa, at 3850m the highest point of the Langtang trek. At Kyangjin we stayed at a lovely guest house which had a dining room with lots of windows: it was warm enough most of the day and we could enjoy the views on the snow covered peaks of the himalayas surrounding us. 

The owner was a lovely lady, always smiling and singing. She even gave us a concert with her friend and they showed me (Steffi) and Sydra a tibetan dance while they were singing. Unfortunately the buddhist monastery in the village was closed but more importantly the "cheese factory" (Swiss technology from 1959) was open and provided us with some stinky but very yummy yak cheese :-)

The way back down from Kyanjin Gompa was relatively quick, and sadly we had to say goodbye to our friends Mihail and Sydra :-( We took a turn up to Thulo Syabru where we are currently enjoying the views onto the Tibetian and Nepalese mountains. In a couple of minutes we're heading off to Sing Gompa (3300m), then to Laurebina (3925m) to finally reach the sacred lakes of Gosainkund (4430m). So we'll have to be prepared for lower temperatures and thinner air again.
