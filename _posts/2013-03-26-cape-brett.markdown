This past weekend we did the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=-35.2153&amp;lon=174.3117&amp;zoom=13&amp;layers=M">Cape Brett track</a> in the Bay of Islands. We drove up there with Arne, Yangyang and Sebastian and arrived Friday quite late, so that we hardly realised the beauty around us. The backpackers we stayed at was located directly at the sea with a nice little beach, lot's of space and a nice little dog.

Saturday we did the track from the road end all the way to Cape Brett. Took us ~8.5h including breaks to enjoy the beautiful Bay of Islands and a side track to Deep Water cove where we had a swim in the bay. Very refreshing - it was still hot but the summer is slowly retreating down here ;( 
Shortly before the Cape Brett lighthouse we were welcomed with some spectacular cliffs and views across some islands, one of the nicest placest we've seen here so far! The hut itself is actually very close to the famous 'hole in the rock', a touristy place at the very outside of the Bay of Islands that Steffi and I visited 6 years ago - being the normal tourists we were back then ;) 

The Cape is stunning aswell and Steffi and I actually slept outside of the hut, just with our sleeping bags in the (relatively high and cosy) grass. First it was quite bright from the moon, and once it disappeared we saw so many stars, and the milky way - unbelievable!
 
The track was quite hard but definitely worth the effort, I'm pretty sure we'll do it again. This time we took a water taxi back. Slightly frustrating to see that you can be back where you started in 20 mins after you walked for a whole day ;)
