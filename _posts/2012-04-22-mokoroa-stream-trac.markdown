It's getting colder on this side of the planet, but that's only true in general. Today in particular we had a nice sunny day and decided to go out for the Mokoroa Stream Track with Antoine and Keith. It was one of the best hikes we did in NZ so far: only 45min drive from our place we made our way down to the Mokoroa Stream and followed it upstream to the Mokoroa Falls, crossing the stream several times in knee-deep water - very refreshing! The track itself wasn't physically hard, but one has to concentrate as it was quite slippery. It reminded us a bit of canyoning, just without a wetsuit ;)
