We just returned from a short trip to <a title="Tawharanui" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=-36.370503,174.8281&amp;spn=0.05052,0.099478&amp;sll=-36.371608,174.83119&amp;sspn=0.050519,0.099478&amp;oq=Tawharanui&amp;t=h&amp;z=14" target="_blank">Tawharanui</a> which is a conservation area for native species and plants: they basically created a fence around the area, killed all species that were brought to New Zealand by humans and introduced the native ones back. So if you are a rat, possum, rabbit, weazel or similar, Tawharanui is not a good place for you.

Despite the opportunity to see some native wildlife it's a gorgeous place with a long beach and a good surf. There was also an art gallery and an outside exhibition with some quiteÂ extraordinary sculptures in a nice surrounding. It was photo-weather, so here you go:
