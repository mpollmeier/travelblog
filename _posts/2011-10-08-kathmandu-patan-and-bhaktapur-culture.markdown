Yesterday and today we explored the cultural heritage in the greater Kathmandu valley. There's a lot of temples and other holy places around to visit and see for both pilgrims and tourists. The architecture is astonishing as you can see here:

The weather is very nice indeed - around 25C during the day and a little more chilled in the night. Hardly any clouds - despite the smoke that's coming out of the exhausts of the buses, cars and motorcycles which are all rather old. Even travelling by taxi is quite an adventure ('traffic rules' are more regarded as recommendations here). And it's hardly exciting due to the terrible air on the main roads. You can't even see much of the surrounding mountains due to the smog in the whole valley. We're happy to be back in less busy Boudha now for our last night in the monastery guest house.

Tomorrow we're travelling to Pokhara further west. Thanks for your comments, much appreciated. Speak to you later!
