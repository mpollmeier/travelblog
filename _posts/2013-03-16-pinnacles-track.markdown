Last weekend we did the Pinnacles track with Cisco, Keith and Yangyang. We drove down to the Coromandel peninsula Saturday afternoon and did an abseil close to our campground just before sunset. There were no clouds at all and we could see a lot of stars during the night, really nice! Sunday morning we started the track up towards the Pinnacles and got there by lunchtime. Quite a spectacular place with great views across the Coromandel all the way down to the sea (the Pinnacles are the highest spot of the peninsula). It's also famous for hosting a scene in Lord of the Rings - no idea which one though ;) 

It's quite a dry summer this year in New Zealand so we has a lot of sun again - in fact it's the dryest summer in 30 years! On the way to and from the Coromandel we saw a lot of yellow grass, totally uncommon for New Zealand where it's usually super-green all year round.
