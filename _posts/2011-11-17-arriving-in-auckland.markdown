Just to let everyone know: we safely arrived in Auckland and are quite busy finding a flat. We're currently staying in an appartment in the CBD, but hopefully we'll find something very soon. The rental market here is pretty active with loads of new offers coming in every morning. However there's also many people interested and you have to be very quick - in fact it already happened twice to us that we wanted to make a commitment and the flat was already gone. So we're learning some lessons and also get to see the different suburbs and their distinct characters.Â We're seeing three flat tomorrow and four more on saturday, so hopefully we'll be more lucky this time.

Thanks for following and commenting on our blog so far. We'll keep this one open for future ventures including trips in New Zealand. This is a photo from our appartment, we'll post more photos of Auckland later.
