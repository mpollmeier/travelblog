Last weekend we drove up to <a title="Waipoua Forest" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Waipoua+Forest,+Northland,+New+Zealand&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-35.690764,173.671188&amp;spn=0.390933,0.795822&amp;sll=-35.742611,173.800964&amp;sspn=0.195339,0.397911&amp;oq=Waipoua+Forest&amp;hnear=Waipoua+Forest,+Northland,+New+Zealand&amp;t=m&amp;z=11">Waipoua Forest</a> for a three day camping trip with the uni crew. We actually called in glamping as it was quite glamorous camping ;)
While Jen, Danish Mike, Antoine and Peter slept in tents, Steffi and I stayed in our car - we just put the mattress from our sleeping sofa into the back - quick, easy and comfy enough for a few nights.

Waipoua Forest is home to the biggest and also some of the last Kauri trees in New Zealand, so we had to go there and hug a few. They are actually quite fragile and one shouldn't stand on it's roots and this might kill the trees. There's also been warnings because some Tyrannosaurus Rex has been sighted, so we had quite an adventurous time ;)
We also did a day trip to the beach and walked along the shoreline and fields, enjoyed the breeze, watched the birds and threw some skeptical looks at the guys who were driving on the beach with their SUVs and motobikes.
