As many of you already know we've just started a long trip to Nepal. We've been here two years ago and loved it so much that we decided to come back, this time for a whole two months. 

After lots of great but exhausting social stuff back home in Germany we've just arrived to the marvellous 12th century city of Bhaktapur, close to Kathmandu but much nicer. Up until now we've mostly chilled, enjoyed the great food (from tourist restaurants aswell as local street dealers) and the afternoon sun. 

We're off to Kathmandu tomorrow and will start the Langtang trek and some side routes the day after. 
Depending on mobile coverage and electricity we might not write anything new here for the next ten days or more (we'll not hike in a rush). Depending on mobile coverage and electricity we might not write anything new here for the next ten to twelve days.
That's it for now, nothing exciting but some folks like to see that we're still alive ;)
