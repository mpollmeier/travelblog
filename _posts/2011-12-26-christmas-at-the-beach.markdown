Merry Christmas everybody!

We spent Christmas day with a number of other Christmas orphans from England, Denmark, Canada and France at the wonderful beach ofÂ <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=Karekare,+Auckland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-36.98874,174.476194&amp;spn=0.012889,0.026715&amp;sll=-36.992407,174.479542&amp;sspn=0.025776,0.05343&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hnear=Karekare,+Auckland&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">Union Bay Karekare</a>. Spending Christmas at a sunny beach felt rather strange first, but we brought along the Christmas tree (named 'Christmas Mike') from the office in uni - that helped a lot ;)

A nice picnic, beers and some minor sunburns later we made it into the water for a refreshing jump into the big waves. One of us actually brought a few surf- and bodyboards and gave some lessons which was great fun. In the evening we had a very nice barbeque - which is the typical kiwi christmas do. Although we missed our families and friends this was definately the best way to spend Christmas over here!

Today we made another excursion to the <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=hunua+auckland+park&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-37.092362,175.134172&amp;spn=0.051485,0.106859&amp;sll=-36.921011,174.555795&amp;sspn=0.206404,0.427437&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hq=park&amp;hnear=Hunua,+Auckland&amp;t=h&amp;fll=-37.096812,175.140953&amp;fspn=0.051482,0.106859&amp;z=14">Hunua Ranges</a> with some nice walks in dense forest which was just enough excercise to finish the leftovers from yesterday's barbeque ;)
