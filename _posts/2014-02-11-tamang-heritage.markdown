The last trek in the Langtang area (north of Kathmandu) we've done is the Tamang heritage trail. It was established by a couple of NGOs to promote tourism in the area and to give tourists an experience f the Tamang culture with homestays instead of guest houses.   
The trek was really nice, but is already well established and lots of guest houses are open. So only the fact that there's less tourists and the locals are less used to tourists really makes it different from the other treks. 

We took a bus from Syabru Besi to Chilime, then hiked up to Tatopani the next day. Totopani is nepali for 'hot water' - there were really nice hot springs close to our guest house that invited to relax. 
The next day we hiked up to Nagthali which is on the top of a mountain (~3300m) with great views on the surrounding himalayan peaks. Before we went to bed we enjoyed those views again - we didn't need flashlights to roam around as the moonlight was so strong.
Unfortunately the next day (today) started with clouds and snow, so instead of going up to another viewpoint and spending another night on the trek we made our way down and back to Syabru Besi.

Tomorrow we'll take a jeep back to Kathmandu where we'll stay a few nights, then we're off to Pokhara for some relaxation (and eventualy more trekking), and it's also time for Michael to trim his beard ;)
