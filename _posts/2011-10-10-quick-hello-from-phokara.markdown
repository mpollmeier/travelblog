Hey guys,

yesterday we arrived in Pokhara after a 7 hour bus drive. We used the rest of the day and today for preparation (several permits, last minute shopping) and some relaxing near the lake in a very nice garden restaurant which was completely empty (only a small turtle was with us). Food over here is delicious - we loved Indian food before and the Nepalese food is nearly as good. And cheap - if you think in European prices.

Tomorrow we will start trekking in the Annapurna region of the Himalaya, so you probably won't hear from us the next one or two weeks.

Until then,

Steffi &amp; Michael
