Saturday we visited the nice Wenderholm regional park (roughly 45mins drive from Auckland) for a little trek and enjoying a nice beach in a quiet bay. It was quite warm (especially while hiking) and we were thinking about having a swim in the sea. However the weather has been alternating a couple of times during the day, and there were some big clouds coming up. 

If you wonder why you haven't got any presents so far: no worries, Santa is starting the annual Christmas business in New Zealand. We saw him next to the beach and took a quick photo before he disappeared again! He must have felt very warm though as he had all his winter wear on ;)
